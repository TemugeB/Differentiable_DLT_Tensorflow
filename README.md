# Differentiable_DLT_Tensorflow
Tensorflow implementation of differentiable DLT

This is a differentiable Direct Linear Transform(DLT) implementation in Tensorflow. The original version was implemented by Remelli for pytorch. Please check his github for the pytorch implementation here: https://github.com/edoRemelli/DiffDLT. I converted pytorch function calls to tensorflow calls and wrapped them into keras layer. 

I've also included a triangulation demo and a gradient descent demo. Check these demos to see how to use the DLT class.
